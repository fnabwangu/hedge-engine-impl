Yes — you can. Below is a **ready-to-use draft license** that:

* **reserves copyright** to you,
* **permits** non-commercial, personal research and study, and
* **expressly forbids** commercial use, redistribution/synchronization, and using the work to train/seed LLMs or any model for anything other than personal, non-commercial study.

This is a **custom, restrictive** license intended for the goals you described. It is **not** a standard open license (e.g., MIT/Apache/CC) — it’s an explicit rights reservation with narrow permissions. If you plan to enforce it or use it for a commercial product, you should **have it reviewed by counsel**. I’ll include a short “how to apply” section after the license.

### Important notes & disclaimers

* **This is a custom license** drafted for your stated goals. It is **not** a substitute for legal advice. If you intend to rely on this license for enforcement (especially to police model training or commercial misuse), **have it reviewed by an attorney** experienced in IP and software/data licensing.
* The phrase **“synchronize”** is intentionally broad to prevent systems that replicate or distribute the Work (cloud sync, indexing, CDNs). If you mean something narrower, tell me and I can tighten the definition.
* The **LLM prohibition** is explicit: the license prevents using the Work to train/augment models for public/commercial use and prevents submitting it to services that reuse user data for training. That’s enforceable only to the extent you can detect misuse; include watermarks or metadata in the Work to help auditing if you need enforcement.
* You may want to offer **a commercial / research license** for those who want to use the Work to train models or for commercial use — create a separate paid license/agreement for that purpose.
